# Cplusplus-Codes
  
This repository contains implementations of basic to advanced data structures and algorithms generally taught in college.
All the codes are written by me,though I have taken help from geeksforgeeks.com ,wikipedia and other websites.
These implemetaions are from the perspective of a student who learnt them for the first time .

* Note : Some of the implementations may be erroneous and need to be reviewed. *
* Implementations can be naive and can be certainly improved. * 
* Note to new learners : Instead of copying the code, try to implement it by yourself. *
